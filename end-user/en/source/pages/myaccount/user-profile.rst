Viewing Your Statistics
-----------------------

When you log in to the UForge Portal, the first tab is the ``Dashboard`` page. This page presents your user statistics.

On the ``Usage`` page you can quickly see:

	* Your current usage of the platform.  This provides a summary of the number appliances, software components, machine image generations and scans created as well as the disk usage consumed.  Any quota information is also shown with a threshold indicator on whether your current consumption is close to the quota limit.
	* An ``Appliance Activity`` displaying the number of appliance templates and machine image generations created though time.  It also provides a breakdown of operating systems used in the appliances and the types of formats of the generated machine images.
	* A ``Scan Activity`` displaying the number scans and machine image generations created though time.  It also provides a breakdown of operating systems found for each scan and the types of formats of the generated machine images.
	* A ``Disk Usage`` displaying the disk space consumed (software components, machine images and scan data currently stored).
